# Exploratory Data Analysis

An approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics.

During this process, you'll find out what questions you want to answer using the data.

Conducting EDA:
- Avoid making assumptions
- Examine data types
- Examine key properties


Things to consider when doing EDA:

Granularity
- What does each record in your data represent?
- How fine or coarse is the data?

Scope
- What does the data describe?
- Does the data cover the topic you're interested in?

Temporality
- When was the data collected?

Faithfulness
- How accurately does the data describe the real world?
- Should you trust this data?
