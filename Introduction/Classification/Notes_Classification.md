# CLassification

Classification is an important Machine Learning technique.

- Process of making categorical predictions using data.
- You have some data in the correct categories.
- You want to learn from this data.

Classification Uses
- Make weather forecast
- Classify email as spam and not spam
- Predict if a patient has a disease
- Predict which cadidate a person will vote for
- Predict the genre of a song, movie or TV show
- Predict wheather two users are compatible

Observation
> A situation where you want to make a prediction
- Attributes are known aspects describing the observation
- Observation belongs to a class, which is not known
- Classification predicts the classes using the attributes


Attributes
> Certain aspects that describe the observation

Training Data
- Contains observation that have been classified
- Analyzing the training data builds a classifier
- Classifier is an algorithm to classify future observations.


Binary classification
> Performed where the classification task at hand involves observations
> that each belong to one of two classes.

Multiclass classification
> Performed when the classification task involves observations 
> that each belong to one of multiple classes (More than two)
