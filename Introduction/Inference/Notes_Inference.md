# Inference

Statistical Inference:
>The process of using data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying probability distribution.

Statistical Inference Examples
- Election forecasting
- Test score predictions

Statistical Inference Methods
- Hypothesis tests
- Confidence intervals


Designing a Hypothesis Test
Null hypothesis
> Does not state that there are associateions between variables, and 
> usually attributes trends observed in the sample to random chance

Alternative hypothesis
> Attribues trends observed in the data to associations between variables

The goal of a hypothesis test is to decide betwwen the null hypothesis
and the alternative hypothesis.


Test statistic
> Helps you decide betwen the two hypotheses.

Permutation test
> Randomly permute, or rearrange, the data

Bootstrapping
- Can simulate new random samples by resampling
- Resampling consists of sampling at random
- Each time you resample, you compute an estimate of the unknown
- Collect all the estimates computed along the way
- Using your estimates, you create a confidence interval
- You then know your unknown parameter is within that interval
